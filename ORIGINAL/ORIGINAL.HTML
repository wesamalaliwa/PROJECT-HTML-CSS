                            The concept of codding sparked a flare within me to dive deep within this field, i found myself always wanting to learn more and expand my knowledge and I saw orange codding academy  a great opportunity to enhance and refine my abilities within this field.

                            I'm Wesam, a guy that is driven by ambition and curiosity, I have always been fascinated by the technical side of my major, which is civil engineering, and I am always looking for new and emerging technologies to learn about. while I was in collage I have chosen to be a barista due to my passion to socialize and help people to make them happier, the other reason is how complex the coffee is and the factors that are involved in preparing it from roasting to brewing.
                            I am super energetic, optimistic and synergic team player with high imagination capacity.
                            My interests are music ranging from listening to writing, learning about foreign cultures with their traditions and visiting places that I have never went to.
